## Recommendations
***
### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
The main advice that  would provide would be to expand its fraction offerings.  Currently it only looks as if stocks and crypto are offered. I would recommend offering a full suite of products to customers including options, futures, mutual funds and bonds.

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Giving the customer more available products should attract more customers to use the platform and generate more revenue per customer as transaction volume increases. Furthermore, alternative products to traditional stocks are seeing a substantial increase in volume in the past few years.  Specifically with options, sekingalpha.com posted the following chart which shows the large increase in single stock daily option volume in the past three years:(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4494087-option-flow-2021-retail-rising)

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Initial thought is that the expansion into additional product offerings mentioned previously would not require additional new technologies but just an adaptation of existing API’s
